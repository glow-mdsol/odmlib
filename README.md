# odmlib

## Introduction
The odmlib package simplifies working with the CDISC ODM data exchange standard and its extensions, such as 
Define-XML, in Python.


## Getting Started
The odmlib package enables Python developers to work with ODM and extensions as a Python object model.
It can serialize that object model as valid XML or JSON.


## Examples
Example code is available in the odmlib_apps repository that demonstrate how to use odmlib. 
Selected examples include:
* xls2define: generates a Define-XML v2.0 file from a metadata spreadsheet
* define2xls: generates a metadata spreadsheet from a Define-XML v2.0 file
